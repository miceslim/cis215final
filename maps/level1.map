    Upon landing, you notice that your communication transmitter has been torn clean from the side of your mailing ship.
    You read that right: torn. With erratic, can opener-like scrapes where it was installed.
    What was that object you ran into, anyhow? You decide to use your ship’s scanner to try and find any electronic signal in the vicinity.
    You find only one signal nearby: due north, through a dense frozen forest, smack dab in the former colony’s center.
